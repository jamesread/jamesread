## A "full stack" Open Source Enthusiast

Coding has been my main hobby since I started in about 1999, but I have hundreds of projects that have never been released. I've always been too terrified to self-promote and contribute to open source because fear of rejection, and communicating effectively. I'm trying to change that now. 

My coding .plan (Oct 2024):

- âš¡ **Contributing**: [Postiz](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app) - new user experience (Containers, Docs, CI, etc), now focussing on developer experience (Unit tests, Deps, dev containers, more CI, etC)
- ðŸ”­ **Maintaining**: [OliveTin](https://github.com/OliveTin/OliveTin) (very proud of this!)
