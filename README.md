## A "full stack" Open Source Enthusiast, who enjoys coding as my main hobby.

Coding as a hobby since about 1999, but with hundreds of projects that have never been released. I've always been too terrified to self-promote and contribute to open source because fear of rejection, and communicating effectively. 

My coding .plan (Sept 2024):

- âš¡ **Contributing**: [Postiz](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app) - new user experience (Containers, Docs, CI, etc), now focussing on developer experience (Unit tests, Deps, dev containers, more CI, etC)
- ðŸ”­ **Maintaining**: [OliveTin](https://github.com/OliveTin/OliveTin) (very proud of this!)
- ðŸŒ± **Creating**: [Japella](https://github.com/jamesread/japella), [SpaghettiCannon](https://github.com/jamesread/SpaghettiCannon) 
- âš¡ **More of me**: [Homepage](https://jread.com), [My Code, Containers & Cloud blog](https://blog.jread.com)
